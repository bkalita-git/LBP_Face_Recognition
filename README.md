--->there are two directory within this directory-
	1. program ---which contains source files to execute the program
	2. report --- which contains project reports
	


--->System requirements for the system
	1. python 2.7 or later
	2. OpenCV 3.4 
	3. GCC compiler

--->TO RUN THE SYSTEM
	1. run the accuracy.sh to compute the accuracy of recognition (note: the accuracy in the program computed as how many faces are correctly 									             recognized out of total tests images)

	2. run face_rec.sh to recognize faces which are in test directory


--->To import a face database, just create sub directories under a directory(name: your_database) and store all those face images in those sub 	        	directory where each sub directory named as the person name

--->To test face images just store the images to be tested in the test directory as a directory named anything.
