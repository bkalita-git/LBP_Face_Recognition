# FACE RECOGNITION SYSTEM


There are two directory within this directory - 
 1. program, which contains source files to execute the program
 2. report,which contains project reports

System requirements for the system - 
 1. python 2.7
 2. OpenCV 3.4
 3. GCC compiler

To run the system - 
 1. run the accuracy.sh to compute the accuracy of recognition (note: the accuracy in the program computed as how many faces are correctly recognized out of total tests images)
 2. run face_rec.sh to recognize faces which are in test directory

To import a face database, just create sub directories under a directory(name: your_database) and store all those face images in those sub 	        	directory where each sub directory named as the person name.

To test face images just store the images to be tested in the test directory as a directory named anything.
